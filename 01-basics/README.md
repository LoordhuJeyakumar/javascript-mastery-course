# Module 01: JavaScript Basics

Welcome to the foundation of JavaScript! In this module, we will cover the building blocks of the language.

## 🧠 Real World Analogy
- **Variables**: Think of them as **labeled boxes**. You can put things inside (data), take them out, or change what's inside.
- **Data Types**: The *kind* of thing in the box. Is it text (String), a number (Number), or a Yes/No switch (Boolean)?

## 📚 Topics Covered
1.  **Variables**: `var`, `let`, and `const`.
2.  **Data Types**: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined.
3.  **Operators**: Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), Assignment (`=`), and Comparison (`==`, `===`).
4.  **Type Coercion**: How JS handles different types together.
