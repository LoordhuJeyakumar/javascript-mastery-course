# Module 09: Final Project - Task Manager

Congratulations! You've made it to the final module. Now it's time to put everything you've learned into practice.

## 🎯 Goal
Build a fully functional **Task Manager** application.

## 📋 Requirements
1.  **Add Task**: Users should be able to type a task and add it to the list.
2.  **Delete Task**: Users should be able to remove a task.
3.  **Mark as Complete**: Users should be able to click a task to mark it as done (strikethrough).
4.  **Persist Data**: Tasks should be saved in `localStorage` so they don't disappear on refresh.
5.  **Filter**: (Bonus) Add buttons to show "All", "Active", or "Completed" tasks.

## 🛠️ Starter Code
We have provided `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` to get you started.
- `index.html`: The structure is ready.
- `style.css`: Basic styling is applied.
- `app.js`: Contains comments to guide you.

## 🚀 Steps
1.  Select elements (Input, Button, List).
2.  Add event listener to the "Add" button.
3.  Create a function to render tasks to the DOM.
4.  Implement `localStorage` logic.
5.  Add delete and toggle functionality.

Good luck!
