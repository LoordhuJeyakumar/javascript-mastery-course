// 🎯 Assignment: Prototypes & Classes

/*
  PROBLEM 1: Basic Inheritance
  1. Create a constructor function 'Vehicle' that takes 'make'.
  2. Add a method 'start' to 'Vehicle.prototype' that logs "Starting {make}...".
  3. Create an instance and call the method.
*/

// Hint: Use the 'new' keyword to create an object from a constructor.


/*
  PROBLEM 2: Converting to Class
  Convert the 'Vehicle' constructor and prototype method from Problem 1 into an ES6 Class.
*/

// Hint: Use the 'class' keyword and define methods directly inside the block.


/*
  PROBLEM 3: The Super Class
  1. Create a class 'ElectricCar' that extends 'Vehicle' (from Problem 2).
  2. Add a property 'batteryLevel'.
  3. Override the 'start' method to log "Starting {make} with {batteryLevel}% charge".
*/

// Hint: Don't forget to call 'super(make)' in the constructor of ElectricCar!
