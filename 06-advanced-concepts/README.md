# Module 06: Advanced Concepts

Mastering these concepts will take your JavaScript skills to the next level.

## 🧠 Real World Analogy
- **Closures**: Like a **Backpack**. When a student (function) leaves the classroom (scope), they take their backpack with them, keeping their own supplies (variables) safe.
- **Classes**: Like a **Blueprint** for a house. You draw the blueprint once, and you can build 100 identical houses (Objects) from it.

## 📚 Topics Covered
1.  **Scope & Hoisting**: How JS finds variables.
2.  **Closures**: Functions remembering their outer scope.
3.  **The `this` Keyword**: It depends on how the function is called.
4.  **Prototypes**: How inheritance works in JS.
5.  **Classes**: Syntactic sugar for prototypes.

## 💻 Assignments

### Daily Practice
- Create a closure that acts as a counter.
- Create a class for a `Person`.

### Weekly Challenge
- **Library System**: Create classes for `Book` and `Library`. The library should be able to add books and find books by author.
