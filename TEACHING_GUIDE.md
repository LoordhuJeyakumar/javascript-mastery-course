# 🎓 Instructor's Teaching Guide

This guide is designed to help you teach this JavaScript course effectively. The course follows a **Practical-Based Learning** approach, meaning students learn by *doing*, not just listening.

## 🏫 Class Structure (Recommended Flow)

For each module, follow this 4-step process:

### 1. Concept Introduction (10-15 mins)
- Open the `README.md` of the module.
- Explain the **"Why"**: Why do we need this concept? (e.g., "We need variables to remember data like a user's score").
- Use the `cheatsheet.md` to show the syntax clearly.

### 2. Live Coding / Demonstration (15-20 mins)
- **Do NOT just read slides.** Open VS Code.
- Create a temporary file (e.g., `lecture.js`) inside the module folder.
- Write code **live** in front of the students.
- Make mistakes intentionally! Show them what errors look like and how to fix them.
- **Interactive**: Ask students, "What do you think will happen if I run this?" before running the code.

### 3. Student Practice (Daily Assignments) (15-20 mins)
- Direct students to the `assignments/daily` folder.
- These are small, isolated tasks.
- Give them time to solve it themselves.
- Walk around (or check screens) to help those stuck.
- **Review**: Pick one student's solution or show yours at the end.

### 4. Weekly Challenge (Homework / Project Work)
- The `assignments/weekly` folder contains a larger task.
- This connects multiple concepts (e.g., Variables + Math + Logic).
- Assign this as homework or a weekend project.

## 🛠️ How to Use the Repository

### For the Instructor
- **Live Coding**: You don't need pre-written files for everything. Use the `cheatsheet.md` as your script. Write the code fresh to show the *process*.
- **Solutions**: You can create a `solutions` branch in git to hide answers, or just keep them in a separate folder on your machine to reference.

### For the Student
- They should clone this repo.
- They should write their answers directly in the assignment files (e.g., `assignments/daily/1-variables.js`).
- They can run their code using `node assignments/daily/1-variables.js` or by linking it to an HTML file.

## 💡 Teaching Tips

1.  **"I don't know" is okay**: If a student asks a tough question, say "Let's test it together!" and run the code.
2.  **Focus on Debugging**: Teach them how to read error messages. This is the #1 skill for a developer.
3.  **Real-world Context**: Always relate code to real apps.
    - *Arrays* -> "Like a list of products in a shopping cart."
    - *Objects* -> "Like a user profile with name, email, and photo."
    - *Functions* -> "Like a 'Buy Now' button that does the same thing every time."

## ✅ Checklist Before Class
- [ ] Review the `cheatsheet.md` for the day's module.
- [ ] Try the assignments yourself to anticipate common stuck points.
- [ ] Have your VS Code and Terminal ready.

Happy Teaching! 🚀
