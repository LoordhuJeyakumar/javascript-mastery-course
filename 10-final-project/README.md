# Module 10: Final Project - Graduation Day! 🎓

Congratulations! You've made it to the end of the course. Now it's time to prove your skills by building a real-world application.

## 🎯 The Challenge
You will build a "Capstone Project" that combines logic, UI interaction, asynchronous data, and local persistence.

## 📋 Pick Your Project
We have designed 5 unique projects for you to choose from, depending on what area of development you enjoy most.

👉 **[View the Capstone Project Guide](./PROJECT_GUIDE.md)**

## 🚀 Steps to Success
1. **Choose**: Pick a project from the guide above.
2. **Plan**: Sketch your UI and list your variables.
3. **Build**: Start with the HTML structure, then the JS logic, then the CSS.
4. **Test**: Make sure your app doesn't crash if someone types weird data.
5. **Polish**: Add that extra "Wow" factor with animations or clean styling.
