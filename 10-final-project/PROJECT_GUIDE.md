## 🛠️ General Requirements
Every project must follow these rules:
1. **Clean Code**: Use descriptive names (no `x` or `data1`).
2. **Encapsulation**: Use functions to solve small problems.
3. **Persistence**: Save user data so it survives a page refresh (where applicable).
4. **Wow Factor**: Use CSS to create a premium, polished look.
